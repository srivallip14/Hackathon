solving real-world problems using advanced analytics and machine learning.Utilized an ensemble of LightGBM and XGBoost classifiers to build a high-performance predictive model. Applied K-fold cross-validation to ensure generalization and prevent overfitting.

Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and further optimized performance by adjusting the classification threshold beyond the standard 0.5, resulting in improved accuracy and class balance.
